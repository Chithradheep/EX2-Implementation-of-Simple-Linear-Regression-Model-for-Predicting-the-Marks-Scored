# EX2 Implementation of Simple Linear Regression Model for Predicting the Marks Scored
## AIM:
To implement simple linear regression using sklearn.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Get the independent variable X and dependent variable Y by reading the dataset.
2. Split the data into training and test data.
3. Import the linear regression and fit the model with the training data.
4. Perform the prediction on the test data.
5. Display the slop and intercept values.
6. Plot the regression line using scatterplot.
7. Calculate the MSE.

## Program:

## Output:



## Result:
Thus the univariate Linear Regression was implemented to fit a straight line using least squares using python programming.
